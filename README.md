When you make any change to any file in your project, you’re making a commit. If you fix a typo, update a filename, or edit your code, you can add it to GitHub as a commit. Your commits represent your project’s entire history—and they’re all saved in your project’s repository.

With each commit, you have the opportunity to write a commit message, a short, meaningful comment describing the change you’re making to a file. So you always know exactly what changed, no matter when you return to a commit.
